  # Secure Data Transmission:
      All data transmitted between the front-end and back-end is encrypted to ensure confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access.
  # Password Storage:
      Users can securely store website URLs, usernames, and passwords within the application. All stored passwords are encrypted using robust encryption algorithms to protect sensitive information.
  # Password Generation: 
      The application offers a password generation feature that allows users to generate strong, randomized passwords for their accounts with adjustable complexity settings.

  # Backend:
      The backend is powered by Node.js, which handles user authentication, password management, and data encryption/decryption.
  # Database:
      Prisma and PostgreSQL are used to store user data securely. Passwords are hashed before being stored in the database to prevent unauthorized access.

# Security Measures:
  # Encryption:
     Data transmitted over the internet is encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols to protect it from interception by unauthorized parties.
  # Hashing:
     User passwords are hashed before being stored in the database, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, passwords remain secure.
